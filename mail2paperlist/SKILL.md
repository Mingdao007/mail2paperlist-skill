# Mail2PaperList

## Purpose

Use when the user wants to turn academic email alerts, Google Scholar alerts, or webmail paper leads into a source-checked paper list or filterable reading board with relevance, topics, summaries, checkpointing, and privacy-safe read-only mailbox handling.

Keep this `SKILL.md` as a concise routing and execution entrypoint. Do not load
long examples, command catalogs, detailed checklists, or edge-case policy until
the current task needs them.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the user request matches this skill's frontmatter description.
2. Bind the concrete target: source file, artifact, repo, device, document,
   dataset, or user-facing deliverable.
3. Use the smallest relevant workflow from this entrypoint first.
4. Load `references/entrypoint-details.md` when the task needs detailed
   procedures, examples, command recipes, acceptance criteria, or one of the
   detailed sections listed below.
5. Preserve local owner boundaries: route to a narrower skill or repo-specific
   workflow when the detailed reference indicates a more specific owner.

## Detailed Reference

Read `references/entrypoint-details.md` for:

- Overview
- Trigger Conditions
- Privacy And Side-Effect Boundary
- Workflow
- Artifact Guidance
- Validation Checklist
- Recovery

## Validation

- Use the skill-specific validation or acceptance checks from the detailed
  reference before declaring completion.
- When editing this skill, run `quick_validate.py` on the skill directory and
  verify all referenced files still exist.
